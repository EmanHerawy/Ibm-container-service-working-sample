# Privacy Notice
For serviceability needs regarding the number of network activity, IBM has added a mechanism in the ordering service to collect a "pulse" from the networks. The UUID of a network is collected periodically and sent to a monitoring service, there is no blockchain or transaction information or data gathered or accessed. The only purpose is to provide information on activity passing through the ordering service.

The UUID is generated by the network randomly when the orderer comes up and is not attached to any further network information. The UUID is re-generated and old UUID lost whenever the ordering service is restarted.
